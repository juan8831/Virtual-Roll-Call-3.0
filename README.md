# Virtual Roll Call 3.0 

Police officers use a roll call system to relay important information at the beginning of each shift. Unfortunately, many officers are sometimes unable to attend roll due to various circumstances such as traffic, court obligations, and early assignments. Virtual Roll Call was a solution deemed fit by the Pinecrest Police Department to allow officers to view information provided at roll call at their earliest convenience, without missing any vital information.

Virtual Roll Call is a web application that allows Supervisors to upload documents and watch orders to the system and Officers to view/download these documents and orders. The application is completely customizable by Administrators, who can add/edit/delete users from the system, add categories to upload documents under, and change logo and the department name, so that other police departments can use the system in the future.

By having the roll call system virtualized, officers are always up to date on the latest briefings, and can carry out their tasks efficiently, which will be a great service to the community.
